        <h1>CSS Basics</h1>
        <p> Inline CSS is where you include the style tag in your paragraph tags. Embedded CSS is when you create it as a new style tab. External CSS is similar to embedded but your going to take the CSS and put it in another file. What ever you would have put in the style tag you put in the CSS external.  </p>
        <p>Why? most websites are generated not by hand, when someone goes to design the page they don't need to worry about what is encoded into the html. So the programmer of the html should only use the external so that as the designer goes to design or change color they can.  </p>
        <p> A selector is used to decide where and what gets hit with the properties of the css.
