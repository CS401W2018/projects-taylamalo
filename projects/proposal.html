            For my final project, the webpage I want to create is "The ultimate guide to visit Orcas Island!" Orcas is my home town and I thnk having grown up there I have the best plan to maximize anyones vaction!
        </p>
        <p>
            The reason I chose this topic is because honeslty I've have just become so greatful of where I come from. And it's so fun to share about where I'm from I love to tell people about it and I thnk I will really have a lot of fun creating this webpage! I also lived there for over 8 years and like I mentioned before I think I know my way around and could create the guide for anyone visiting the island! 
        </p>
        <h2>Home Page</h2>
        <p>
            The home page will first give basic info about what the guide is and how it can help to plan the trip to the island. It will give a history of the island, and introduce you it for those who have never been. 
        </p>
        <h2> Ferry Boat</h2>
        <p> The next page will be all about travel. The first things you need to know if the ferry schedule, I will give all the information needed to know how to make a reservation, what to expect, what times the ferries run, etc. A table will be created with the ferry times, how many stops it makes, and how long the ride is. I will include on this page, how early to arrive, what to do while you wait, what do once you get on the ferry, sights not to miss while on the boat and much more!  </p>
        <h2> Accomidations </h2>
       <p>
        On this page I will go through all my favorite places that you can stay while you visit the island. There are a variety of options, from location on the island, air b&b, hotels and camping. I will detail a few of my personal reccomendations on what options are best and why so the views can decide what option would work best for them! 
       </p>
       <h2> Food </h2>
       <p> This page will definitely be one of my favorites! There are so many unique and fun places to eat randomly around the island! I will detail some the best options and what my reccomendated orders would be. Again I will detail out what each of my favorites has to offer so again who ever is using the guide can best decide what works best for them! </p>
       <h2> Activities</h2>
       <p> The next page will be all my reccomendations on what to do for activites while your on the island. These will be based on what time of year you come to the island. Based on that I will provdie a detailed list of activites that you can enjoy in that season. </p>
       <h2> Local life</h2>
       <p> My last page will be a look into what it's like to live on the island. While many come to visit often, very few know what it's like to grow up there. This page will hopefully give an inside look at the island and all there is there. </p>
        <p>
            I will use the form to get feedback on if the guide is helpful and get suggestions on what other info to add. From the view I will get their name, where they are from, if they did visit the island or if they plan to, where they able to try some of the recommendations, the foods, or activites, did they stay where I reccomended? Is there anything they did that they would suggest I put on the guide? Any thing I should take off? How long did they stay? and Whould they come again? <br>
            For the table I will use it to display the ferry times and information, it can get confusing on what time the ferry leaves, what time you need to arrive, how many stops it makes and how long the ride is. So I will detail the table with all of these factors to help the views have less confusion. 
        </p>

           For collecting data and all the info and pictures I will be using the local newspaper, chamber of commerce and other local websites! To view the local newspaper and chamber of commerce websites please click the links in the navigation tab!
