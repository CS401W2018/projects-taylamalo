        <h2 class="sub">Background</h2>
        <p id="one"> <span class="emp">I love to play volleyball!</span> I have played since I was young and it was always something that was fun for me. Throughout my years of playing I have played lots of different positions, so I think I have a well rounded set of skills on how to play overall. </p>
        <h2 class="sub">High school</h2>
        <p class="emp"> In High School, I played all 4 years on varisty. My whole time I was a setter. I would say setting is definetly my favorite position to play. I love the connection of how you rely on the passers and then give it to the hitters. I think its fun to be the middle of whats going on. Besides that in school, I was able to be named one of the caption of the teams as well. It was one of the best expirences for me because it allowed me to grow in so many ways and helped guide me to the person I am today.  </p>
        <h2 class="sub">Links</h2>
        <p id="one">Relative links are links that are included in the same folder. It links to a webpage within your own created pages. So basically its like a relative of the webpage your on. So the relative page is linking a page that is already inside your webpages. </p>
        <p id="one"> Absolute links are different because they link to a webpage outside of your folders, this can link to pages that have been created by someone else, anywhere on the web.  </p>
        <p id="one"> An example of an relative link is <a href="introPage.html"> here</a></p>
        <p id="one"> An example of a absolute link is <a href="https://www.islandssounder.com/sports/grateful-to-be-back-on-the-court/">here</a></p>
