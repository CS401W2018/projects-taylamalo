    <h1>Tayla Malo</h1>
    <h2>Talofa, here is a little bit more about me!</h2>
    <p> I was born in Provo, Utah, but when I was around 9 years old I moved to Washington State. For the most part I consider that where I grew up. </p>
    <p> One thing I love to do is play volleyball! I grew up playing and it has always been a fun thing to do with friends and family. I always played as a setter, but I really like to hit!</p>
    <p>Another thing I like to do is to read. I love books, my aunt is an author so I love reading her books! My favorite kind of books are love stories!</p>
    <p>I am the oldest of 6 kids, and I love them all but I definitly have favorites. Here are there names in order of which I like best! </p>
    <ol type="A">
        <li>Isabella</li>
        <li>Lili</li>
        <li>Sandra</li>
        <li>Timoteo</li>
        <li>Tomasi</li>
    </ol>
    <p>My <mark>favorite</mark> quote is: </p>
    <blockquote>&quot;In this life you either <em>crank that souja boy</em>, or <strong>it cranks you</strong>&quot;</blockquote>
