        <p> My hero when it comes to volleyball is a girl named Whitney Bower. She was a setter for BYU team, I found out about her my junior or senior year of school I believe. The first thing I learnt was that she was skipping her senior year to go set for BYU I was so interested by that. She is so good. Her sister also played with her but her sister was a passer. I would always watch her setting videos because I wanted to be just like her. </p>
